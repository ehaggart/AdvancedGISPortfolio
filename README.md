# About me 
Hi everyone, I'm Elizabeth. I'm wrapping up my second year as an MSPPM at Heinz. I'm originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, but have lived in Carlisle, PA, Washington, DC, Pittsburgh, PA, and New York, NY. Prior to Heinz, I spent time working in fundraising for a nonprofit. I enjoyed a lot of the backend database work and decided to pursue a master's degree at CMU to advance my data analysis and management skills. I'm hoping to translate those skills toward corporate social responsibility and foundation management.

For fun, I love to travel. My favorite city in the world is London, but my favorite trip I have been on is a Safari in Botswana. I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to travel more in the future. During our new virtual classes, I have been spending a lot of time with my two dogs, Shelby and Haley. I'm looking forward to developing this site more over the semester!

# What I hope to learn
During the intro GIS, I loved learning about the tools and having the ability to create maps around topics that I was interested in. I'm excited to have the opportunity to refine those skills as well as learn new tools to create maps. Throughout my systems project and other work related projects, I have come to understand how important maps can be as a visualization tool. Sometimes data is best seen through maps rather than charts or other visualizations. I look forward to further developing my skills as a map designer and begin to understand my spatial preferences past the basics I learned in the intro class. 

I hope having access to additional tools other than just ArcGIS will provide me with skills that can be transferable outside of the academic community. I am also hoping to further my skills in understanding the best way to use maps and dashboards to represent and analyze data.
