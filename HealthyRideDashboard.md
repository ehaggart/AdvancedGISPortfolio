# Healthy Ride Dashboard

Pittsburgh has a lot of sites and attractions to offer. As biking become a more popular transportation option, particularly as new ride sharing systems become available, I was interested in exploring bike infrastructure in Pittsburgh. 

Healthy Ride is a bike sharing system that allows riders to rent bikes for 30 minutes free at a time or subscribe to the service for increased ride time. The service has over 100 station locations throughout the city of Pittsburgh. I was interested in examining the placement of these stations relative to existing bike infrastruce.

This dashboard provides a comhrehensive view of possible biking options for those new to the city of Pittsburgh using the Healthy Ride bikes. It provides the option to select a station location, see what attractions are within a 15 minute and 30 minute distance from the station, existing bike infrastructure to use to get there, and additional stations to drop the bike off once users have arrived at their destination. Hopefully, this dashboard will serve as a one stop location for users to learn how to bike safely through the city while having fun.
