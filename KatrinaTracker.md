# Katrina Tracker

I worked on tracking a time lapse of Katrina's Path. I think this was an interesting experiment working with the time series lapse in Arcgis Pro. 

This is a tool I would love to gain more exposure with as it provides a great opportunity to not only visualize data, but see how it changes over time.

The map can be viewed [here](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=8ea59c2038d54ce9aa559bce773cc667)
