# Dallas Police Beat and Zip Code Relationship

This is a project I am working on in collaboration with the Dallas Court and Detention Services to understand compliance rates of Class C Misdemeanors in Dallas. These violations are fine based offenses that most often are related to traffic violations, but are also considered qualtiy of life violations.

This map aims to show the relationship between the Police Beat where a ticket was issued and the zip code where individuals live. This will help to understand how close to home people are receiving violations.
